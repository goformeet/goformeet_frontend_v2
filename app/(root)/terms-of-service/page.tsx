        <p>
          If any provision of the Agreement is held by a court of competent
          jurisdiction or arbitral tribunal to be unenforceable under applicable
          law, then such provision shall be excluded from this Agreement and the
          remainder of the Agreement shall be interpreted as if such provision
          were so excluded and shall be enforceable in accordance with its
          terms; provided, however, that, in such event, the Agreement shall be
          interpreted so as to give effect, to the greatest extent consistent
          with and permitted by applicable law, to the meaning and intention of
          the excluded provision as determined by such court of competent
          jurisdiction or arbitral tribunal.

          breach excused, unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and

          Goformeet of any breach by you, whether expressed or implied, shall
